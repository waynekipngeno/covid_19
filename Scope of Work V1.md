   1. ### Determine the infection rate of covid-19 in the world and in each country
   1. ### Determine the mortality rate of covid-19 in the world and in each country
   1. ### Identify countries with high infection and death rates
1. ## PROJECT ACTIONS
These are the actions or interventions that these project will inform.
1. ### Development of criteria for vaccine distribution by the WHO.
1. ### Identify countries that need additional funding relief to manage spread and impact of covid-19.

1. ## ANALYSIS TO BE DONE
   1. ### Using available data to identify high-risk countries i.e those with unusually high infection rates and death-rates
   1. ### Use data to identify high-risk populations 
   1. ### Use data to determine countries with growing new causes i.e likely indicator of new variant

1. ## DELIVERABLES
   1. ### List of countries to prioritize during vaccine roll-out
